Sphere2 development starts from Sphere1 freez version which was last modified on March 3, 2016 
(just before AE's seminar at ANL PHY Division).

Compilation of the Sphere2 is easier. Installation elswhere is now simplified.

To compile create setup.sh and Makefile based on examples that are included for psec and UCLA machines.
